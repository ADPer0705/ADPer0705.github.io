  "bio": "I'm Anay Dhaval Pandya — a Computer Science student specializing in Cybersecurity at the National Forensic Sciences University, Gujarat. I explore the intersections of AI, systems engineering, and security, building tools that blend practicality with curiosity — whether it's automating workflows, designing intelligent assistants, or dissecting how systems break.\n\nWhen I'm not buried in terminal windows, I'm chasing the \"why\" behind the tech — from how networks trust, to how intelligence emerges in code. I draw a lot from the Stark principle: engineering that feels alive — intuitive, elegant, and human.\n\nLately, my focus has been on bridging human intent and machine execution — creating systems that understand context, not just commands.",
